/**
 * ArraySort represents information relevant to sorting arrays.
 *
 * When data needs to be sorted according to one or several attributes,
 * we can use ArraySort to represent the sorting information and generate
 * appropriate hyperlinks that can lead to sort actions.
 *
 * When creating an ArraySort instance, you need to specify {@link keys} of the
 * array. You can use ArraySort to generate hyperlinks by calling {@link link}.
 * You can also use ArraySort to modify a {@link CDbCriteria} instance by
 * calling {@link applyOrder} so that it can cause the query results to be
 * sorted according to the specified attributes.
